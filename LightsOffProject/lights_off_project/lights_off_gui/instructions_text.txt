Hello again! I see you are ready to become a 
little more adventurous, and decided to  jazz up
the game... That's great! 
If you would like to create a marvelous board of 
your own, to start the game with, you can do so,
by clicking on the  "Personalized Map" button. 
There you can toggle the lights on and off state 
until  you are happy with  the board you created,
then click save. In this case, however, you must 
play using the standard rules (on a 5x5 board, 
with horizontal and vertical neighbourhood).
If, on the other hand, you consider yourself a 
pro in this game, why not make it harder, and 
change the settings by clicking the "Set 
Configurations" button? You can, of course, make
it easier if you wish! It's up to you! You get to 
choose the size of the board, the lights on and
off colours, as well as the neighbours that 
change their on and off state, according to the 
light you press. And,  before I forget, if you're
really up for a challenge, you can play the game 
in "fast game" mode. That should be interesting.
But remember.. You can't choose your own
settings, as well as create a personalized
map.
Now, go on, have fun!

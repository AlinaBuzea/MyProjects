Hello! I see you wish to know a little 
bit more about this game. So, here are 
the rules: the game consists of an MxN 
grid of lights. When the game starts,
a stored pattern of these lights is 
switched on. Pressing any of the lights
will toggle its and the adjacent lights
on/off state. As the name suggests, the 
goal is to switch all the lights off. 
You can choose the rules you want to 
play by in the settings. However, if 
this is your first time playing Lights 
Off, we recommend playing by the 
standard rules.. You can easily find 
some tips on how to solve it! :)
Have fun!
